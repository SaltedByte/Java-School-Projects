# Java-School-Projects
These are projects that I worked in for my NKU degree that were written in Java

If you are reading this hopefully it is to review some code that I wrote! There are 6 java files here that I have written for different classes of mine over my time at NKU.  Each one was completely written by me for the purpose of NKU Java courses.

Distinct.java-
This is a rather simple program.  All that it does is accept 10 numbers values as inputs without verifying the inputs are numbers (this was an intro java course when I wrote the assignment.) The program then decides which inputs are unique and which ones are duplicates.  Then it outputs the list of unique numbers

ExploreMatrix.java-
This is a much more exciting program.  For the sake of testing.  A user choosen sized matrix is generated of 1's and 0's.  Then a variety of logic is use to determine for say if a row has all 1's or all 0's in it.  This could very easily be expanding upon to create the game rules behind a tic-tac-toe game or potentially even a game of life simulator.

FilesInDir.java-
Another simple program.  This just demostrates recursion.  It will take a directory and count the number of files in it.  It does not count folders but instead calls itself again to count the files of that folder as well.

InPlaceHeapSort.java-
This is an implementation of a heap sorting algorithm in java.  It uses comparison to sort the heap by value of least to greatest and has a very efficent big O notation.

KnapSack.java-
This is a interesting one I did for a CSC364 project.  It solves the classic I have too much stuff with different weights and values, but can only carry so many things.  What is the most effiecent use of my space.  This program creates a matrix of that and will step backwards through the matrix to arrive at the solution.  The program could be tweaked to provide solutions for any problem.

MyDoublyLinkedList.java-
This one is exactly as it sounds.  It is a linked list class that can be stepped through not only forwards like a conventional linked list, but can also be stepped through backwards and loop for end to beginning or beginning to end!
